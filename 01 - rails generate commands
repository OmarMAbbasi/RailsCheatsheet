rails g migration <name> # Generates migration based on name. Use to update table

rails g model <name> ##Generates a Model along with a migration. Use this when creating a new model

rails g controller ##Generates an empty controller and a folder for your views. 


--- Advanced Commands ---

rails g scaffold ##Generates migration, model, controller, and views for the class you give it. Will error out if you try to do this on an existing model
        WARNING: There's a lot of advanced/junk code that comes with this that isn't super relevant to the assessment. 
        This just fleshes out some pretty basic stuff. I wouldn't experiment this much unless you're already comfortable with rails.

rails g scaffold_controller ## Does the same as above but will not error out when building ontop of an existing Model like the above will. 

replace g with d to destroy everything with that name
